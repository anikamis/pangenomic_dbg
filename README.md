# Genomics Final Project

**Our project is divided into 3 different deliverables:**

1. **Python visualization library** for classical and colored de Bruijn graphs

2. **Python tool to form succinct colored de Bruijn graphs** of pan-genomic sequences

3. **Full-stack app** for compressed colored de Bruijn graph visualizations

Please refer the README in each of the subfolders on directions for installation. These should ideally all be run in a local environment.
